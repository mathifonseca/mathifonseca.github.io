				<h2 class="section-title">Building & Leadership</h2>
				<div class="content">
					<p>I am a seasoned software and payments professional with a deep passion for building and scaling companies. As a founding team member, I played a key role in creating both PedidosYa and Payrails, contributing to their growth from the very start in various capacities. Although I started my career as a headphones-always-on coder, given the startup fast-paced and solution-oriented mindset, I quickly realized that understanding the broader business and product context was essential to making impactful contributions. Over time, I took on responsibilities beyond pure technical work, including aligning with business interests, collaborating with product and data teams, and even collaborating with sales teams. This holistic approach has allowed me to better understand user needs, prioritize development efforts, and drive value across both technical and business dimensions. My experiences across these ventures have equipped me with a unique perspective on how to navigate challenges, innovate, and lead teams to success in fast-paced environments.</p>

				<h2 class="section-title">Payments & Fraud</h2>
				<div class="content">
					<p>My expertise in payments and fraud prevention started as just a project at PedidosYa, but ended up becoming my main expertise. It has allowed me to drive impactful projects at PedidosYa, where I integrated many providers in Latam to provide our users with the best payment experience while keeping fraudsters out. After successfully building the solution and leading the teams, I moved to Delivery Hero HQ in Berlin. There I led the global fintech strategies from the technical perspective, overseeing and evaluating the integrations of payment systems across multiple countries and payment methods. In my role as a Solutions Architect at Payrails, I designed the product from the ground up, applying all the lessons learned in the past to help global businesses scale their payments and financial services.</p>

				<h2 class="section-title">Architecture & Engineering</h2>
				<div class="content">
					<p>My career spans a wide range of technical roles, with a focus on software architecture and engineering leadership. Iâ€™ve built and maintained complex systems, worked with cutting-edge technologies, and designed scalable and efficient platforms. This has included collaborating with various engineering teams to ensure alignment across diverse projects and global markets, while maintaining consistency and high performance. While my career steps led me to be further away from the code and closer to the people, I never actually stopped coding, it's still one of the most fun parts of my job.</p>

				<h2 class="section-title">Teaching & Mentorship</h2>
				<div class="content">
					<p>Teaching has always been a driving force in my career. I began as a Software Architecture and Software Engineering in the Cloud professor at Universidad ORT Uruguay, where I had the privilege and challenge of sharing my knowledge with the next generation of engineers. This passion for teaching continues in my professional life, where I conduct workshops, mentor colleagues, and foster growth and knowledge-sharing within my teams. I am committed to creating a culture of continuous learning and helping others develop their skills.</p>
